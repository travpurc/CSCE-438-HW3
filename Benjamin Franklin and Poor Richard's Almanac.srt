00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so where we left off in the last video, where Benjamin Franklin was born, to appear the tenth son, to a Puritan father, of Boston...

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
working for his brother as an apprentice at age twelve, but then runs away at seventeen
right he runs away he had written the silence do good essays


3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
him writing these Soutine silence due good but Franklin didn't want to remain an apprentice even though he was bound do to so

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Night time, he gets on a boat in Boston, sails originally to New York and after a few 

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
is to continue on to philadelphia going up the uhh the philadelphia bay, the deleware bay and into the river, and onto the market




6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
[Voice 1]: ...of Philadelphia and there's a famous scene of him arriving [Voice 2]: this is seventeen years old, young kid [Voice 1] seventeen years old, bedraggled, wet...

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He has only a few coins in his pocket, as he arrives at the wharf he gives one of the coins to the boat man as a tip, he says when you're really poor

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
People don't know you're poor, so you pretend to be a little bit richer, so there it is Franklin already caring about his public relations, uhh


9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
sort of being a typical American, saying I don't want to look like I'm poor, I'm going to be a generous guy marching up Market Street

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
off he rolls and he's all wet and bedraggled. He passes a doorway and there's a fifteen year old girl named Deborah Reid.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and she sort of laughs at him, thinks he makes a ridiculous looking figure. Now we know this because years later

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
